  - ✅"PostConstruct", "BeforeDestruct" inside contexts
  - Lazy beans (needed?)
  - Context inheritance (needed?)
  - JetBrains platform plugin for DI-Cat support:
    - Errors highlighting
    - Navigation between Beans
    - ...
  - ✅Inject beans to class from node_modules (only if it has .d.ts declaration file)
  - ✅Refactor "TypeQualifier"
    - ✅Bean injection, when one Bean implements multiple types/interfaces e.g. `crudRepository: IReadRepository & IWriteRepository = Bean(CRUDRepository);`
    - ✅Bean list injection e.g. `@Bean drawer(figures: IFigure[]): IDrawer => new Drawer(figures)`
  - ✅Add "Expressions" and "Arrow Functions" Beans. Examples:
